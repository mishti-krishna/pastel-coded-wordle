#### this is my wordle clone, called **WORDLE OFFLINE**a project i made in my senior year of high school for my finals. i took inspiration from the famous new york times' wordle game.
### what sets this apart from the ny times' wordle, or other wordles in the market?
### this wordle:
- uses python + tkinter.
- was made by a non-caffeinated 17 year old in 2 days 
- is entirely pastel coloured.
- runs offline.
- has a built in "rules" window, in case you, the player is not familiar with the widely known wordle mentioned above 
- will be updated regularly.
### to run this game, please proceed to download the python file and the text files included in this repository and place everything in the same folder. please do not change the filenames of this project once downloaded in your system.
#### happy playing!
